# Neural Network Implementation

This project implements a neural network from scratch in Python. It includes classes for neurons, layers, and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), as well as a custom `Value` class, that performs differentiation using the chain rule.

## Features
- Custom `Value` class for differentiation
- `Neuron`, `Layer`, and `MLP` classes for building neural networks
- `Tanh` activation and custom backprop enable gradient-based learning.
